## Introduction
Stress detection is an important application of machine learning in healthcare and mental well-being. This project aims to analyze and predict stress levels using a dataset containing relevant features. The Jupyter Notebook includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is included in the repository or can be downloaded from [source link if available]. It contains features such as [list key features, e.g., heart rate, sleep patterns, etc.] and a target variable indicating stress levels.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Srayoshi-Mirza/Stress_Detection_Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Stress_Detection_Analysis
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Stress_Detection.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate the results.

## Methodology
The project follows these steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
3. **Model Training**: Training machine learning models such as [list models used, e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.].
4. **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The final model achieves [insert performance metrics, e.g., 85% accuracy]. Detailed results and visualizations are provided in the notebook.
